`rintimg` is an R wrapper of the
[intense-images](https://github.com/tholman/intense-images) JavaScript
library. Using `rintimg` you can view an image in full screen by
clicking on it. The package works on Rmd documents and Shiny
applications. It’s extremely simple to implement: you only need to run
one function : `img_intensify()`.

You can install `rintimg` from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("rintimg")
```
