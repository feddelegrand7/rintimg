`rintimg` is an R wrapper of the
[intense-images](https://github.com/tholman/intense-images) JavaScript
library. Using `rintimg` you can view an image in full screen by
clicking on it. The package works on Rmd documents and Shiny
applications. Itâ€™s extremely simple to implement: you only need to run
one function : `img_intensify()`.

You can install the development version of `rintimg`from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("feddelegrand7/rintimg")
```

# Demo

You can find a demo [here]()
